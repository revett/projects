  summary:
    text: The Pennine Way is the oldest, and arguably the most iconic, of
      England’s National Trails. Starting in the Peak District and stretching
      north to the Scottish Borders, it is one of the most challenging but
      rewarding long-distance walking routes and is steeped in history.
