  summary:
    text: Offa's Dyke Path, while not being the longest of the National Trails,
      is one of the most attractive and varied. The 177 mile route crosses high
      wild moorland, attractive well cultivated wide river valleys and ancient
      woodland. It passes through historic towns and isolated hamlets. En route
      can be seen hill forts, castles, abbeys and surviving remains of the
      habitations of former occupants of the beautiful corridor of the path.
      The flora and fauna are as rich and as varied as the scenery.
