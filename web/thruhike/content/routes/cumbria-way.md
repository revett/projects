  summary:
    text: The Cumbria Way is a 112km (70 miles) linear long distance footpath in

      linking the two historic Cumbrian towns of Ulverston and Carlisle. The
      route cuts through classic Lakeland country via Coniston, Langdale,
      Borrowdale, Derwent Water, Skiddaw Forest and Caldbeck. It is a primarily
      low-level long distance footpath but does contain some high-level exposed
      sections.
